**About me:** I am a researcher working on genetics of complex traits. I am trained in Mathematics, but slowly getting into the field of genetics. I started this site for fun, and hope it will serve as an external memory device of mine. By writing them out for a wider audience, I also hope to make my research reproducible and learn a few things along the way. It would be awesome if someone else out there can find something of value here too. If you have any comment or questions, would love to hear them!

**About this site:** Welcome to my blog. It is a rather cheesy name with 'Ai'（爱） means love in Chinese and obviously sounds like 'i', like the trendy electronic product. I will post here on topics mostly spanning from my work -- genetics of complex traits, statistical method, bioinformatics pipelines. How genetics can help us to identify our ancestry? How does our genetic information influence phenotype? How far away are we from precision medicine? As well as posting technical discussions, I'd like also to engage some general interests to this exciting field of research.
