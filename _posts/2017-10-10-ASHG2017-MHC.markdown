This year I'm bringing two posters for ASHG, the seocond one, is on how to improve HLA typing and association studies based on high-coverage whole-genome sequencing.
\\
In this work, we show that high-coverage WGS opens new opportunities to study one of the most changlling regions of the human genome -- HLA. By ultising information from WGS, we constructed the first multi-ethnic HLA reference panel at G-group resolution.
